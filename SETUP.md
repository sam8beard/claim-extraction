# Getting Started 

### Run `generate-env.sh`
```bash
./generate-env.sh
```
This will generate a default `.env` file in the project root directory to be used by your program. 

>NOTE: **All values modified here must also be changed inside `docker-compose.yaml`, `mc-setup.sh`, and `pg-setup.sh`**.

### Run `docker-compose.yaml`
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This will set up all the containers for services that are used within this project.

### Run `mc-setup.sh` 
```bash 
./scripts/mc-setup.sh
```
This will run and configure your MinIO client with all of the default values in the `.env` generated by `generate_env.sh`.

### Run pg-setup.sh

```bash
./scripts/pg-setup.sh
```
This will create a `documents` table in `postgres` container for pipeline metadata storage

### Run `python-setup.sh`

```bash
./scripts/python-setup.sh
```
This will create virtual environments in the workflows that depend on Python scripts and install the required dependencies for each one.
